<purpose>I want to rigorously evaluate whether purchasing a Ferrari F80 under current liquidity constraints, using a bank loan at a 3% yield, is a sound financial decision, considering the potential to resell the vehicle at a 20% premium. Here are the top factors I'm considering:</purpose>
<factors>
    1. Net Return on Investment (Comparison between the loan interest cost and the expected resale profit) 
    2. Liquidity Management (Ability to cover short-term obligations while capital is tied up in the asset) 
    3. Market Risk (Certainty and timing of achieving the projected 20% selling price premium) 
    4. Transaction &amp; Holding Costs (Fees, taxes, insurance, and potential depreciation during holding period) 
    5. Opportunity Cost (Potential returns from alternative investments or use of capital) 
    6. Bank Loan Terms &amp; Repayment Flexibility (Early repayment penalties, collateral requirements, default risk) 
</factors>
