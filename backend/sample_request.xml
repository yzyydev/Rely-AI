<purpose>I want to rigorously evaluate and compare the strategic trade-offs between developing a custom, in-house CRM versus deploying a SaaS CRM platform—focusing on speed, functionality, cost, and long-term agility—to recommend the best path for sustaining RetailCo&#39;s customer engagement and growth. I&#39;m considering:</purpose>
<factors>
    1. **Time to Market &amp; Agility**  
       Ability to deploy new features and campaigns rapidly without multi-quarter development cycles.  
    2. **Total Cost of Ownership**  
       Up-front development or licensing fees, ongoing maintenance, hosting, and upgrade costs over a 5-year horizon.  
    3. **Customization &amp; Flexibility**  
       Degree to which the platform can be tailored to unique workflows (e.g., loyalty programs, in-store kiosks) and integrate proprietary modules.  
    4. **Integration &amp; Data Migration**  
       Effort required to migrate legacy customer, order, and interaction data, plus connect to ERP, marketing automation, and e-mail systems.  
    5. **Scalability &amp; Performance**  
       Ability to handle traffic spikes (e.g., seasonal promotions) and support real-time personalization without downtime.  
    6. **Vendor &amp; Security Risk**  
       Exposure to vendor lock-in, data governance controls, compliance with PCI DSS/GDPR, and availability of enterprise-grade SLAs and support.
